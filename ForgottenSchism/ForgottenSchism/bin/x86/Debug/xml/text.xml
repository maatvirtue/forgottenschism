		Long ago, the Holy Empire of Constantia existed in the balance of two religions.
		The cult of Vetus, preaching the value of keeping things constant and unchanged
		and the cult of Novum, whose followers were always seeking innovations and 
		change. The two beliefs always coexisted together, complementing each other
		until one day...
		The cult of Novum's thirst for change quickly escalated, the balance between the
		two cults was disrupted and thus began the first civil war in the Constantia
		Empire's history. The cult of Vetus emerged victorious and to ensure peace and
		order would be preserved into the Empire, they exiled any remaining followers
		of Novum on a remote island, one of the Empire's newly acquired colony.
		For the following years, peace remained in the Empire. However, the Empire 
		received reports a few months ago claiming that members of the cult of Novum
		have been gathering, rumors saying they are trying to take over the colony and
		rebel against the Empire. No words from the colony ever since. In order to
		investigate in this matter, the Empire sent a a young general on the island.
		This is where the story begins.
		The future depends on this young man's actions...
